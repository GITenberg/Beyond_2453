description: One of the most prolific and respected authors of the early twentieth
  century, John Galsworthy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932. Although
  not as well-known as the five novels that comprise his enduringly popular Forsyte
  Saga, Beyond displays Galsworthy's fiction-writing prowess at its best.
